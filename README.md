# python-mcommunity

python-mcommunity is a Python library for interacting with the MCommunity API.

## Setting up your environment

python-mcommunity requires Python 3.

For development, we recommend using a virtualenv.

* Run `init.sh` to set up the virtualenv.
* When you want to hack on python-mcommunity, source env-setup.sh
  (`. env-setup.sh`) to set up the necessary environment variables.

## Testing

Tests can be run with `python setup.py test`.

python-mcommunity uses the [pytest](https://pytest.org/) testing framework, so
tests can also be run directly with the command `pytest`.
